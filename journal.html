    <p style="text-align: center; padding: 7%; font: italic bold 12px/30px Georgia, serif;color: black ;">Dravidian University, having come into existence in 1997, traversed a distance of 16 years in time in the cause of the Dravidian. Originated as a university with the special characteristic of serving the cause of the Dravidian, over a period of time, Dravidian University extended, expanded and diversified itself to the other branches of higher education and research. In continuation of this progress, the university branched out and opened new departments in the areas of social sciences, sciences and technology and management, education, and a wing of publications by name, Prasaranga, and the wing of distance education, by name, School of Distance and Continuing Education.<br><br>

      The fledgling university has gradually come of age by acquiring physical infrastructure like buildings for departments and schools/faculty, labs, museums, library of substantial books collection and journals with a wing digitalized library and buildings for administration, and quarters (residential accommodation) for teaching and non-teaching staff.<br><br>
      
      Consequent up on academic diversification the university extended the research concerns, which it has shown and sustained in the areas of Dravidian Languages, Literatures and Culture, to the newly acquired disciplines. This has resulted in research and quality teaching in these disciplines also. This has also resulted in the engagement of university faculty in UGC major and minor research projects. Along with this growth, the university has specifically shown phenomenal development in the publications wing of the university, Prasaranga, which remains as a special feature of the Dravidian University which has facilitated the publication of numerous books of literary value. Focus and Scope of Dravidian Studies:<br><br>
      
      Dravidian University came into existence in 1997 with a view to exploring the cause of the Dravidian, its Languages, Literatures and Culture, and contributing to its sustenance and development. Against this backdrop, the university, ever since its inception, pivoted on to this mission, has opened teaching and research departments which have remained dedicated to the avowed cause. In continuation of the same spirit, the university has embarked on the mission of disseminating the cause of the Dravidian through its publications. One of these is the Dravidian Studies, a peer reviewed quarterly research journal of Dravidian University.<br><br>
      
      Dravidian Studies committed to academic excellence, innovation and research, imbued with dispassionate enquiry, concerns itself with fields of Literatures, Languages, and Linguistics, other disciplines of Humanities and Education and allied areas.<br><br>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;color: #34495E;font-size: 30px; font-family:  Georgia, serif;color: black ;"><u>Message</u></h2>
      
      <p style="text-align: center; padding: 7%; font: italic bold 12px/30px Georgia, serif;color: black ;">Dravidian Studies, a quarterly journal, is 8 years old, and has been instrumental in strengthening the research in the areas of the Dravidian and the allied disciplines. While engaged in this challenging goal, the journal, notwithstanding the obvious odds against it, is marching forward with commitment for academic excellence and ethics. Dravidian Studies is now poised to go on the path of excellence by way of imbibing stringent measures like peer review of articles to ensure high quality of the journal. Against this backdrop, as Vice-Chancellor of Dravidian University and the Chief Editor of the journal, I look forward to receiving contributions of quality to the journal. In the process, I would visualize the future of the journal as the hub of sensitive, sensitizing, intellectual and innovative ideas.</p>
