                    with the initial support extended by the Governments of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala for an
                    integrated development of Dravidian languages, literatures thus paving way for cultural and
                    emotional integration of all the regions that carry forward the ancient historical torch of the
                    nation.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The University, which formally came into existence in 1997, began functioning with two departments in
